# === The Da Vinci Notifications IG inherits all of the mandatory requirements and recommendations defined in the HRex Security which  references the HL7 core security page. Therefore is it not necessary to repeat it in the Da Vinci Notifications IG notification page ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The Security page (security.html) should include a reference to the HL7 core security page (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/security.html).


# === Da Vinci Warning: These versions predated detailed change logs in the Da Vinci Notifications IG ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The home page (index.html) must include an h3 section called Dependencies.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The home page (index.html) must include an h3 section called Intellectual Property Considerations.

# === Da Vinci Warning: The existing sections will need to be reordered in the next version to meet these requirements ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The first menu item under Background should have the label Reading this IG.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The second menu item under Background should have the label Use Cases.
WARNING: DA VINCI: There must be a menu item under Background called Project and Participants.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The first menu item under Specification should have the label Conformance Expectations.

# === Da Vinci Warning: applying this suggested link change causes  a build error ===

# === The profile definitions conform to 3 versions of US Core Practitioner via `meta.profile'. This warning means the examples matches all of them, which is the intent.  Listing of all US conformant US Core profiles is an alternative to creating a single CDex Profile for Patient and Practitioner (or choosing a single US Core Profile) that conforms to  all three US Core versions.  We chose this option because it is direct (vs indirection) and thus easier to understand.

# ===  The Da Vinci Team is aware of this plans to move them in a future publication cycle ===

INFORMATION: CodeSystem/notification-event: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
