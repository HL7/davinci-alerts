# 01. === The Da Vinci Notifications IG inherits all of the mandatory requirements and recommendations defined in the HRex Security, which references the HL7 core security page. Therefore, is it not necessary to repeat it in the Da Vinci Notifications IG notification page ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The Security page (security.html) should include a reference to the HL7 core security page (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/security.html).

# 02. === Da Vinci Warning: These versions predated detailed change logs in the Da Vinci Notifications IG ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changes.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title Version 0.2.0
WARNING: DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changes.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title Version 0.1.0

# 03. === Da Vinci Warning: These sections will be added to Da Vinci Notifications in the next version ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The home page (index.html) must include an h3 section called Content and Organization.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The home page (index.html) must include an h3 section called Dependencies.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The home page (index.html) must include an h3 section called Intellectual Property Considerations.

# 04. === Da Vinci Warning: The existing sections and content will need to be rewritten in the next version to meet these requirements ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The first menu item under Background should have the label Reading this IG.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The second menu item under Background should have the label Use Cases.
WARNING: DA VINCI: There must be a menu item under Background called Project and Participants.
WARNING: DA VINCI: The first menu item under Specification should have the label Conformance Expectations.

# 05. === Da Vinci Warning: applying this suggested link change causes  a build error ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The Propose a Change link must start with https://jira.hl7.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10405&issuetype=10600&customfield_11302=

# 06. === Da Vinci Warning: There were no comments for version 1.1.0 Preview during its review period. Thus,  there are no new Jira tracker items to apply in version 1.1.0. ===

WARNING: DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changes.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title Version 1.1.0

# 07. === Other elements in instance match the slice(s) defined in the profile.  We have checked and confirmed that the targeted slices are not intended to match a slice === 

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/StructureDefinition/notifications-bundle|1.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# 08. === The profile definitions conform to 3 versions of US Core Practitioner via `meta.profile'. This warning means the examples match all of them, which is the intent. Listing all US conformant US Core profiles is an alternative to creating a single Profile for Patient and Practitioner (or choosing a single US Core Profile) that conforms to all three US Core versions. We chose this option because it is direct (vs indirection) and thus easier to understand. See related chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/multiple.20version.20of.20IG.20in.20meta.20profile.20warning  ===
