description: "Since May 1, 2021 CMS requires that hospitals send notifications electronically
  for admit, transfer and discharge events to the patient's care team members, for
  which most implementations currently use V2 ADT messages. As a result DirectTrust,
  a consensus body of forty organizations and individuals representing the care continuum,
  collaborated in creating an Implementation Guide using Direct Secure Messaging for
  both senders and receivers. The Event Notifications via the Direct Standard\xAE
  defines the necessary data element to cover the CMS rules, maps those to the V2
  elements in several ADT message structures and provides the value sets for coded
  elements.\n\nThese V2 elements have been mapped them to their respective location
  in this DaVinci FHIR IG for the Admit-Transfer-Discharge Use case. In addition,
  the value set concepts between the two product families have been mapped, where
  possible.\n\nThis ConceptMap summarizes the Direct ADT message to the Da Vinci Notification
  Terminology Mappings. Complete mappings can be downloaded as an excel file at https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/tables/DirectToDaVinciMap.xlsx.\n"
