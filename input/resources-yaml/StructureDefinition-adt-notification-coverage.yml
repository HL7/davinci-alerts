  The Da Vinci Admit/Discharge/Transfer Notification Coverage Profile is based on the [HRex
  Coverage Profile](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ehrx/StructureDefinition-hrex-coverage.html) and constrains the Patient resource referenced by the
  `Coverage.beneficiary` element to be found in the same message Bundle.

  The Da Vinci Admit/Discharge/Transfer Notification Coverage Profile is based on the US Core
  Coverage Profile and complies with US Core versions 6.1.0, and 7.0.0.  It constrains the resources referenced by the
  `Coverage.beneficiary` element to the US Core Patient
  Profile. It also constrains the referenced resource to be an entry in the message Bundle that it populates.
