  The Da Vinci Admit/Transfer/Discharge Notification Coverage Profile is based on an anticiated future version of the [HRex Coverage
  Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/history.html). It defines the constraints for representing a member's healthcare insurance information to the Payer.  Coverage instances complying with this profile, sometimes together with the Patient which this profile references via `beneficiary`, allows a payer to identify a member in their system.  This profile also constrains the Patient resource that is referenced by the `Coverage.beneficiary` element to be present in the same message Bundle.
