<p>If &quot;true&quot;, implementations that produce or consume a resource defined by the GraphDefinition SHALL provide support for the link in some context dependent meaningful way. If &quot;false&quot;, the link may be ignored and not supported and the whether to populate or use in any way is at the discretion of the implementation. If the extension is missing the link is assumed to be mustSupport = &quot;false&quot;.  It <strong>SHALL</strong> be made clear through additional documentation exactly what kind of support is required, as this can mean many things depending on the use case.</p>
<p>Note that this extension is analogous to the [ElementDefinition.mustSupport] in the FHIR specification.</p>
