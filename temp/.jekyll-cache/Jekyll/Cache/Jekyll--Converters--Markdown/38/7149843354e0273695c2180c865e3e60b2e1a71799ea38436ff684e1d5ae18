<p>The following data-elements are mandatory (i.e., data MUST be present) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (<a href="guidance.html#must-support">Must Support</a> definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The <a href="#profile">Formal Profile Definition</a> below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Each  must have:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>A reference to US Core Encounter Profile which will be bundled in the message</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Additional Profile specific implementation guidance:</strong></p>

<p>Note that for the admission/discharge scenario, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.encounter</code> is a ‚Äúreverse link‚Äù to the Encounter resource and cannot be traversed from the MessageHeader within the Message Bundle.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

Note that these are technically invalid since the profile is defined to references other resources within the same Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle.  A complete list of examples including bundle examples can be found on the <a href="all-examples.html">Examples</a> page.</p>
