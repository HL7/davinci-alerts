<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>FHIR resources can be used to transport patient information relevant to a specific event (e.g. admission, discharge, change in treatment, new diagnosis) to another provider or the health plan. These resources can communicate the details of who, when, what and where care was delivered and help to ensure timely follow-up as needed.  To reiterate, the intent of this guide is to provide a framework to create notifications that can provide enough information to Recipient and/or Intermediary for them to be able understand what the notification is about and complete enough to enable them to determine if and what additional steps they need to take in response to the notification.   The following framework documents how to use <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/messaging.html">FHIR messaging</a> to define the contents of the notification and how to “push” these unrequested notification messages using the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/messageheader-operation-process-message.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code></a> operation directly to Recipients and Intermediaries.  The <a href="usecases.html">Admit/Discharge Use case</a> demonstrates how to implement an unsolicited notification scenario using the framework.</p>

<h3 id="the-da-vinci-notification-message-bundle">The Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle</h3>

<p>For every notification, the object that is exchanged is a <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html#message">FHIR message Bundle</a>. It consists of a Bundle identified by the type “message”, with the first resource in the bundle being a <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a> resource. The MessageHeader resource has a code - the message event - that identifies the reason for the notification.  The MessageHeader also carries additional notification metadata. The other resources in the bundle depend on the notification scenario and form a network through their relationships with each other - either through a direct reference to another resource or through a chain of intermediate references.</p>

<h4 class="no_toc" id="the-da-vinci-notification-message-event-code">The Da Vinci Notification Message Event Code</h4>

<p>The message event codes identify the reason for the notification.  For this framework a set of concepts describing the purpose of the Da Vinci unsolicited notification has been created.</p>

<li><a href="CodeSystem-notification-event.html">Da Vinci Notification Event CodeSystem</a></li>

<p>These concepts represent a ‘starter set’ and will be supplemented with additional concepts in the future. Note that there is no HL7 v2 messaging equivalent to these codes. However when available, a relationship between concepts in the notification event codes and concepts used in the notification “focus” resource is documented. For example in the admission and discharge scenarios the message event codes are notification concepts that correspond to the concepts defining the events in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">encounter.class</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">encounter.hospitalization.dischargeDisposition</code> codes.</p>

<h4 class="no_toc" id="what-is-in-the-message-bundle">What is in the Message Bundle</h4>

<!--
The message bundle **SHALL** include the MessageHeader resource and the resources referenced by `MessageHeader.focus` element. It **SHOULD** include all resources needed for the Receiver or Intermediary to be able to process the message as expected by the the message event *provided that all included resources have a traversal path following Reference or canonical links either to or from the MessageHeader*.
-->
<p>For all Da Vinci Notification Message Bundles, the following resources are mandatory (i.e., data MUST be present) or must be supported if the data is present in the source system (see <a href="guidance.html#must-support">Must Support</a> definition below).  These requirements are illustrated in figure 3 below.  See the <a href="usecases.html">Admit/Discharge Use Case</a> for an example of the required resources for a particular scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Each Bundle must have:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><em>MessageHeader</em></li>
  <li>The event or request resource referenced by <code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageHeader.focus</code>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, the <em>Encounter</em> for admissions notification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Each Bundle must support:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>US Core <em>Organization</em>, <em>Practitioner</em>, or <em>PractionerRole</em> referenced by <code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageHeader.sender</code></li>
  <li>US Core <em>Organization</em>, <em>Practitioner</em>, or <em>PractionerRole</em> referenced by <code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageHeader.responsible</code></li>
  <li>US Core <em>Practitioner</em>, or <em>PractionerRole</em> referenced by <code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageHeader.author</code></li>
  <li>
    <p><em>All</em> resources directly referenced by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageHeader.focus</code> resource. Implementers should carefully consider what information they are willing to share and only include those reference elements for the use case in the focus resources. This can be formally defined by profiling the focus resource.  For example the admit/discharge use case focal resource is the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/coreStructureDefinition-us-core-encounter.html">US Core Encounter Profile</a>.</p>

    <p class="highlight-note">Implementers that use FHIR as their persistence layer may need to modify those resources before assembling the message bundle to avoid sending sensitive or unnecessary data.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>All</em> resources needed for the Receiver or Intermediary to be able to interpret the notification and process the message <em>provided</em> that the resources have a traversal path to or from <code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageHeader.focus</code> resource.  These requirements are use case specific and need to be determined by the implementation community based on their data requirements.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="no_toc" id="how-to-define-the-message-bundle">How to define the Message Bundle</h4>

<p>The set of resources within the message and their relationship to each other can be represented as an interconnected graph of resources as Figure 3 below illustrates (Note that this a simplified and incomplete representation of the possible resources in notification message bundle. See <a href="usecases.html#figure-8">Figure 8</a> for an example of a resource graph for the admission/discharge scenario):</p>

<p></p>
</div>

<h4 class="no_toc" id="formally-defining-the-da-vinci-notification-message">Formally Defining the Da Vinci Notification Message</h4>

<p>The Da Vinci Notification Message can be formally defined in FHIR using a set of FHIR Profiles that constrain links to the message Bundle. The base <a href="StructureDefinition-notifications-messageheader.html">Da Vinci Notifications MessageHeader Profile</a> and <a href="StructureDefinition-notifications-bundle.html">Da Vinci Notifications Bundle Profile</a> are used to define the base constraints for all notification scenarios.</p>

<p>All the profiles that populate the Bundle get enforced by their references and the fact that their <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.aggregation">aggregation</a> is constrained to ‘bundled’.  This means that these references are only to resources that populate the same bundle.  Therefore, starting with the MessageHeader profile, the profiled resources within the bundle form a chain of links that define the bundle.</p>

<p>A use case specific Notification Bundle is defined by starting with base constraints in the <a href="StructureDefinition-notifications-messageheader.html">Da Vinci Notifications MessageHeader Profile</a> and <a href="StructureDefinition-notifications-bundle.html">Da Vinci Notifications Bundle Profile</a> and creating a more tightly constrained MessageHeader Profile. Resources that are referenced within the Bundle are profiled to complete the Bundle definition.  Depending on the use case, existing profiles may be used or new profiles defined.</p>

<p>See the Admit/Discharge use case for an example of using FHIR Profiles to define the Bundle.</p>

<!--
FHIR profiling is more mature mechanism and broadly supported by the implementation community, reference implementations, and validation tooling.  However,there is no mechanism to enforce profiles in a message on a reverse link because “reverse links” cannot be traversed forward from the MessageHeader. It may also require more artifacts than using MessageDefintion/GraphDefinition.
{:.highlight-note}


##### MessageDefinition and GraphDefinition
{:.no_toc}

The [MessageDefinition] defines the event and focus resource of the Message as well as other metadata. The [GraphDefinition] is referenced by the MessageDefinition and it defines the forward and reverse links (paths) between the resources (profiles) that populate the messaging Bundle. This guide defines the following profiles to be used as "blueprints" to create MessageDefinition and GraphDefinition instances for Da Vinci Notifications:

- [Da Vinci Notifications MessageDefinition Profile]
- [Da Vinci Notifications GraphDefinition Profile]

A use case specific Da Vinci Notification Bundles is defined using the base constraints defined in the [Da Vinci Notifications MessageHeader Profile] and use case specific MessageDefinition and GraphDefinition instances. Resource profiles are referenced by the GraphDefinition instance. Depending on the use case, existing profiles (for example, US Core Profiles) may be used or new profiles defined.

See the Admit/Discharge use case for an example of using MessageDefinition and GraphDefinition to define the Bundle.

<p class="note-to-balloters">MessageBundles and GraphDefinition reosurce are alternative to using profiles to define the message bundles contents. However, at the time of this publication, the implementation community, reference implementations, and validation tooling does not fully support them.</p>

<h3 id="pushing-unsolicited-notifications-to-the-receiver-or-intermediary">Pushing Unsolicited Notifications to the Receiver or Intermediary</h3>

<p>As shown in Figure 4, when an event or request triggers a notification, the Sender creates a Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle and notifies the Recipient or Intermediary using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code> operation.</p>

<!-- all this Bootstrap html for getting an image to fit nicely in text - 640 pix wide -->

<div>
<figure class="figure">
<figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 4</strong></figcaption>
  <img src="$process_message_wf.svg" class="figure-img-portrait img-responsive img-rounded center-block" alt="$process_message_wf.svg" />
</figure>

<p></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>For this guide there is no expectation for a notification response message to be returned from the Recipient or Intermediary to the Sender. Therefore, the $process-message input parameters “async” and “response-url” are not used and the body of this operation is the message bundle itself.</li>
  <li>In the context of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code> operation, the Recipient/Intermediary is treated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">“black box”</a> and simply accepts and processes the submitted data and there are no further expectations beyond the http level response as defined in the FHIR specification.</li>
  <li>There is no expectation that the data submitted represents all the data required by the Notification Recipient/Intermediary, only that the data is known to be relevant to the triggering event. The Notification Recipient/Intermediary can optionally fetch additional information from the patient’s medical record using FHIR RESTful searches.  The endpoint for this search may be known or supplied via the $process-message operation payload.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note-to-balloters">We are actively seeking input on whether or not to document how to  transmit endpoint data intended only for the immediate  (which may be the final recipient or an intermediary)  and to provide the recipient with the technical details for getting additional information from the medical record for the alert - Note that this has serious security implications as it may contain sensitive access information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not shown in figure 4, after the Intermediary successfully receives the notification, processes it and optionally searches and process the search results, it redistributes the data to the end users.  It <strong>MAY</strong> use FHIR messaging and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code> operation to do this or some other messaging protocol such as Direct, SMS or V2 messaging.  Note that the Notification Intermediary <strong>MAY</strong> customize the content based on the end user (for example, withholding data that a particular care team member does not need).</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="no_toc" id="usage">Usage</h4>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code> operation is invoked by the Sender using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> syntax:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">POST [base]/$process-message</code></p>

<p>The body of the operation is the Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle containing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The MessageHeader which is the first resource in the bundle and contains the the message event code - that identifies the nature of the notification.</li>
  <li>The other resources in the bundle depend on the notification use case and are defined by either the MessageDefinition and GraphDefinition or FHIR Profiles as described above.</li>
</ol>

<p>An HTTP Status success code is returned on successful submission.</p>

<p>See the Admit/Discharge scenario <a href="usecases.html#example-transaction">Example Transaction</a> for an example of using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code> operation to send a Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle.</p>

<h3 id="reliable-delivery">Reliable Delivery</h3>

<p>Upon receiving a message, the Receiver/Intermediary may return one of several status codes which is documented in <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/messageheader-operation-process-message.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">$process-message</code></a> definition.</p>

<div class="note-to-balloters">
  <p>We are actively seeking input on whether additional guidance should be documented in this guide on FHIR-related errors (in addition to normal HTTP errors related to security, header and content type negotiation issues). For example, whether to define a minimum set of error response code, such as those listed <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#rejecting-updates">here</a>. Additionally, what additional guidance should be provided to specify how the Sender can provide a more reliable delivery of notifications to the intended recipient(s).  For example, defining what actions the Sender must take when it receives a particular error response code.</p>

  <p>At the Dec 11-12 Da Vinci Connectathon we polled the participants and determined that the following codes and guidance could be added:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">200</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">202</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">204</code>+/- OperationOutcome all ok for successful transactions
      <ul>
        <li><em>Issue : what does widely use Java client want?</em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">401</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">404</code>+/- OperationOutcome no point in retry</li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">429</code> +/- OperationOutcome  retry but slow down traffic</li>
