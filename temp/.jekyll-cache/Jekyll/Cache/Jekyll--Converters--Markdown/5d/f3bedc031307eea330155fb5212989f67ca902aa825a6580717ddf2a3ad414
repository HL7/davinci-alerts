<p><strong>Additional Profile specific implementation guidance:</strong></p>

<p>Note that for the admission/discharge scenario, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Coverage.beneficiary</code> is a “reverse link” to the Patient resource and cannot be traversed from the MessageHeader within the Message Bundle.  There is no mechanism to enforce profiles in a message on a reverse link except via GraphDefinition.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p class="highlight-note">The following examples of this profile are freestanding resource instances. Note that these are technically invalid since the profile is defined to references other resources within the same Da Vinci Notification Message Bundle.  A complete list of examples including bundle examples can be found on the <a href="all-examples.html">Examples</a> page.</p>
