In order to be responsible stewards of data, we will need to follow the data governance laws around sensitive conditions. Sensitive conditions are defined to support masking of clinical data that protects consumerâ€™s privacy and are subject to special disclosure rules which govern the distribution of data to external parties.

[The FHIR Security and Privacy Module] describes how to protect a patients privacy through de-Identification, pseudonymization, anonymization. FHIR does not mandate a single technical approach to security and privacy; rather, the specification provides a set of building blocks that can be applied to create secure, private systems.
